Sample mini application which uses the microservices architecture, it uses Docker/Kubernetes and RabbitMQ as a message broker between the micro-services. Docker images compiled for Aarch64 because I used an Apple Silicon machine while practicing with the project. The project was followed using a series of videos made by @binarythistle on YouTube.
